# vlounge

Miss being on campus together with your friends? Here is a virtual lounge experience with asynchronous elements to fill that void!

## video calling system
Feel too awkward to wait in a video call by yourself for friends to join, but still want to talk to them? Join the lounge and flag yourself as ready to socialize! If there is at least one other friend who wants to call, a notification will be sent to you providing a link to a video call, and other people joining the lounge can come in too. 

## collaborative playlists
Get that in-person lounge feeling with a collaborative playlist you can add to and listen to with other people all on one webpage!

## asynchronous :heart:s
Living in a different timezone from your friends? You can still drop by the lounge to leave your friends a couple :heart:s for them to pick up -- and they can leave some for you as well!
